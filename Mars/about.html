      <p>
          My name is Nishant Shukla. I'm currently enrolled as a student at Seneca College in Newnham Campus. I'm currently resided in <i>Toronto, Ontario</i>. I am currently enrolled in
          <dfn><abbr title="Computer Programming and Analysis">CPA</abbr></dfn> program. My hobbies include programming, making beats, and playing soccer. I would like to pursue further in 
          web development. Hence the purpose of this assignment is to refine my html skills and effectively use those skills to make an efficient webpage.
