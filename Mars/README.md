For this following project, I was instructed to create three separate webpages that can be used to refer to the other two webpages. The main webpage which includes all the content.
The content of my webpage is about the planet Mars. This webpage is meant to serve as an information webpage about Mars for the general public. The other webpage must include the 
source of your information, as well as images, audio, and video. The last webpage includes information about the author of the webpage.
