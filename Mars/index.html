                <p>
                    The red planet Mars, named after the <b><i>Roman god of war</i></b>, is the fourth planet in our solar system. It is located about 50 percent farther from the sun than Earth is, with an average orbital distance of 142 million miles.
                With a radius of 2,106 miles, Mars is the seventh largest planet in our solar system. The red appearance of the planet is due to the iron oxide present in the Martial soil. 
                Mars rotates on its axis every 24.6 Earth hours, defining the length of a Martian day. Mars also has 2 moons which are named Phobos and Deimos.

                    Billions of years ago, the Red planet was very similar to the current version of our Planet, Earth. It once had liquid water flowing on its surface. With liquid water on its surface,
                    it might have supported life. However, due to the loss of most of its atmosphere, it's a <strong>cold</strong> barren desert with very few signs of liquid water and life.

                <p>
                    Mars’s axis of rotation is tilted 25.2 degrees relative to the plane of the planet’s orbit around the sun, which helps give Mars seasons similar to those on Earth.
                    However, there are many reasons why seasons on Mars are <em>different</em> then seasons on Earth. Mars is about 50% farther away from the Sun then our planet. This makes it longer for Mars to complete a single orbit.
                    An individual season on Mars can last up to 199 Earth days. On Mars, northern hemisphere experiences longer spring and summer in comparison to fall and winter. Additionally, Mars has a <em>thinner</em> atmosphere.
                    This makes it harder for the planet to trap heat on its surface. On average, Mars is colder than Earth.

                <h2><u>Geography</u></h2>
                <p>
                    The geography of the red planet is rather interesting for a barren planet. It consists of several valleys, canyons, craters, and volcanic mountains. The most well-known feature on Mars is Olympus Mons. Olympus Mons is the 
                    <em>highest</em> volcanic mountain in our solar system. Olympus Mons stands at 26 km above its surrounding plain. To put things into perspective, Mount Everest's height is a third of Olympus Mons. Additionally, despite having thin atmosphere, Martian winds are 
                    capable of reaching speeds up to 60 miles an hour. Due to the fast winds, Mars is capable of kicking huge dust storms and massive sand dunes. A major setback in Mars geography is the <b>lack</b> of active plate-tectonic system. Due to an inactive plate-tectonic system, 
                    it lacks a magnetic field. This makes it easier for the Sun's particles to strip our the atmosphere on Mars.

                <h2><u>Our Future on Mars?</u></h2>
                <p>
                    Since 1960s, we have explored Mars robotically. We have had many Rover-based missions on Mars. However, out of 45 missions launched only 26 of them have failed. Current missions are focused on finding extraterrestrial life on the planet.
                    Elon Musk, the founder and CEO of SpaceX has been enthusiastic about a future on Mars. SpaceX are currently working on vehicle to send humans on Mars.
